Welcome to my portfolio site!
<!-- end -->

As part of learning about the GraphQL API in Gatsby, I've added a blog page to the site in order to dynamically generate a brand new page for each new blog post.

The content of my blog posts will vary and can cover anything from learning programming, music, sports, television, etc.

## Topics Covered 

1. Gatsby
2. GraphQL
3. React
